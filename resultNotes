// Obviously, we can tell that insert does not scale very well.  
// Comparing tinyArray -> extraLargeArray you can tell that it becomes 42,777 times larger
// 
// append, under the same situation is only 55 times bigger.
//
// Another note, you won't notice the slight microsecond difference for tinyArray and 
// smallArray.

// Extra credit - the unshift complexity or big O is O(n) but push is O(1) which means
// that push is shorter over time.  unshift has to incremenet all of the elements
// already present in the Array, but push just drops them all at the end, so in that
// case, none of the Array element indexes have to change.
